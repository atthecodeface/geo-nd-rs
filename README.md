# geo-nd

A collection of vector, matrix and quaternion types and traits for
Rust, particularly aimed at 2D, 3D and OpenGL/Vulkan applications,
where the elements use arrays and slices of floats.

The usage model in 3D graphics is through ownership of large arrays of
floats by the application, encompassing sets of vertices and matrices,
with the library enabling in-place operations on those vertices and
matrices.

The library takes advantage of the developiong
[core_simd](https://rust-lang.github.io/stdsimd/core_simd/) crate to
provide architecture-specific implementations, without attempting to
support architectural SIMD implementations within this crate.

This crate is in alpha; it is used in a small number of applications,
and the functionality is mature, but the API may undergo some changes
in the near future (through Q3 2021) to ensure high performance OpenGL
and Vulkan operation while maintaining simplicity of operation for
other applications.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
geo-nd = "0.1"
```

## Features

This crate can be used with the upcoming [core_simd](https://rust-lang.github.io/stdsimd/core_simd/) crate by enabling
the default `simd` feature. Use this in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.geo-nd]
version = "0.1"
features = ["simd"]
```
